Finished with some errors.
For some reason, I can search "Miller" and pull in results. But if I Search for ANYTHING else, I get all kinds of errors. Still can't pinpoint the root of this issues. 
Didn't implement the buttons. Kept it as a search box for now...

BASIC UI IMPLEMENTED.
SET UP A SEARCH FUNCTION USING THE BREWERYDB API. 
STILL SEEMS BUGGY AS SECOND TIME SEARCHING DOESN'T RETURN CORRECT RESULTS?

PLEASE NOTE - IN ORDER TO VIEW THE RETURNED DATA -> OPEN YOUR CONSOLE TAB IN THE PAGE INSPECTOR.
